# hello-world

Introduction:

I am Richard Myles. 

This is one of the requirements of the lessons/activities in the GitHub guide.

This is readme.md version 0.2

Body:

My name is Richard Myles.

I will make my first app with the tools that have been made known to me here.

It's bringing a tear to my eye to think that this is the heart of the F.O.S.S and it's here for everyone to enjoy.
